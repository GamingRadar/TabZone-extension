# TabZones Chrome Extension

## 🚀 Description  
Do you ever find yourself opening the same tabs every time you sit down to work or study? Dictionary? Reference book? ChatGPT? Yeah, me too. It was driving me crazy! So, I decided to solve this once and for all with **TabZones**, my productivity game-changer.

With TabZones, you can group your favorite tabs into **zones** like "Study" or "Job Hunt" and open them all with a single click. It’s like having your personal productivity toolkit at your fingertips. Plus, adding new tabs to your zones is ridiculously easy. Whether through the popup or a quick right-click menu, it’s all about making your workflow seamless.

I made this extension because I needed it. I’m an engineer, after all—it’s what we do! Now it’s here for you, and I hope it becomes your new superpower too. Let me know what you think—seriously, I’d love your feedback! ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devashishtambade/) link below 👇)
